## Installation
The libraries employed in this project to run the code are Anaconda distribution of Python 3.*, Numpy, Pandas for cleaning, Bootstrap for styling, Plotly for both front end (JS version) and back end (Python version) visualizations, Flask to take care of the routing and Heroku to deploy the web app.
## Project Motivation
This project is aimed at developing a Data Dashboard involving writing Python code that reads in data, cleans the data, and then uses the data to make Plotly visualizations

## File Descriptions
The files associated with this work  are contained in the web_app folder which includes
* The data folder 
* The worldbankapp folder
* The wrangling_scripts folder containing the codes used to clean the data
* The Procfile
* The worldbank.py file which runs on command line

## Instructions 
The web app has a back-end and front-end. To run the app from the workspace, open a terminal and type env | grep WORK. Note the WORKSPACEDOMAIN and WORKSPACEID. To start the web app, type `python myapp.py`

You can open a new browser window and go to the address: http://WORKSPACESPACEID-3001.WORKSPACEDOMAIN replacing WORKSPACEID and WORKSPACEDOMAIN with your values.
